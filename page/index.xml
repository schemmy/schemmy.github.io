      <description>By using Cron, we can schedule the running of scripts at a specific date and time. However, it took me a while to figure out how to make it work on AWS EC2 to schedule a python task. Below are steps.
1). Need to add conda activate env_name in bash file, so that conda environment is activated automatically before Cron runs.
2). Create Cron jobs by crontab -e. After setting up the scheduled time following syntax of Crontab, we need to first cd to the path of python script.</description>
